# docs/

Reference material, specs, and planning artifacts live here. Add new language notes, design docs, and roadmap updates alongside `plan.md` so contributors can discover documentation in one place.

- `tokens.md` — summarizes the Runic lexer/token vocabulary and how each
  category maps to commands, pipelines, declarations, and interop features.
- `module_authoring.md` — walks through structuring modules, wiring manifests,
  and surfacing typed exports for the loader.
- `migrating-from-bash.md` — step-by-step guidance for porting existing bash
  scripts to Runic while leaning on compatibility blocks where needed.
