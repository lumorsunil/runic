# docs/

Reference material, specs, and planning artifacts live here. Add new language
notes, design docs, and roadmap updates alongside `plan.md` and
`progress.md` so contributors can discover documentation in one place.

- `tokens.md` — summarizes the Runic lexer/token vocabulary and how each
  category maps to commands, pipelines, declarations, and interop features.
